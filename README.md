# Design_of_a_WSN

## 1. Introduction

The aim of this report is to describe the process of creating a wireless sensor node. To achieve this aim, several objectives need to be fulfilled, such as understanding the components being used in the node, building connections between the components in the node, ensuring the components functioning correctly, building a wireless network, transmitting data over the wireless network and monitoring them using user interface platform.


## 2. Background

To build this wireless sensor node, have received several electronic components such as an ultrasonic sensor (SRF05), temperature sensor (TMP 36), accelerometer sensor (LSM 303 DLHC), micro-controller (LOLIN D32 pro), voltage regulator (5V) and 9V battery. They can be classified into three main subsystems of a node such as sensing subsystem, processing subsystem and power subsystem. Moreover, it can mention the wires and breadboard of the node as a communication subsystem. Here, the aim is to build a wireless network. Therefore, needed a processing subsystem that can communicate wirelessly. It is the reason that LOLIN D32 Pro is being used here. It has Wi-Fi connectivity and Bluetooth connectivity.

To make this wireless network construction possible, tasks have been broken into four sub-tasks: familiarising with the components, examining WSN using connection cable, building a monitoring platform and examining wireless communication. Stage 1 is about learning the components’ functions and pin assignments. The second stage is working with the components using relative instructions with Arduino IDE, and the third stage is designing a webpage with the help of HTML and displaying sensor data. The final stage is building wireless communication using suitable network and MAC protocols. At the end of these stages, the project will achieve its aim of creating a wireless sensor node. Figure 1 shows a Gannt chart showing the activities that took part in the assignment process.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Familiarisation of the Components

This is the first stage of this project. In this stage, the components are collected and relevant data sheets are obtained to identify components’ pins and functionalities. They are presented in the Table 1 under different rows describing each component’s function, pins and features.
